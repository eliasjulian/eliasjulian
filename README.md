# Hey, I'm Elias
(he/him) I'm a senior product designer at [FireHydrant](https://firehydrant.com/), designing and prototyping the future of incident management for customers like Peloton, Stack Overflow, Twilio, 1Password, and many more. Previously I worked with early stage startups at a little design studio called Catalog, and spent years in individual contributor roles at both startups and agencies. Located in the small mountain town of Pine, CO in the Rockies. Lets play Destiny or ~Fifa~ EA Sports FC and talk about bikes.
