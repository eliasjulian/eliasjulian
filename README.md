# Hey, I'm Elias
(he/him) I'm a product designer with a strong focus on prototyping, interaction design & design systems. Most recently I was at FireHydrant building a new on-call & alerting product for modern engineering teams. Before that I worked with early-stage startups to build 0 to 1 products at a design studio called Catalog, and spent years in individual contributor roles at both startups and agencies prior to that. Located in the small mountain town of Pine, CO in the Rockies. Lets play Destiny or ~Fifa~ EA Sports FC and talk about bikes.
