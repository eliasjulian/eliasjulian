# Hey, I'm Elias
(he/him) I'm a product designer at Bonusly, a startup in Boulder, where I'm working on designing apps for healthier workplaces, specifically focusing on feedback and engagement tools. I also make [asciimoji.app](https://www.asciimoji.app/) and I'm exploring web3 by drawing with code over on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@elias). Previously I've worked in various design and art direction roles at agencies, small and large. Currently living in sunny Boulder, CO but I'm an east coast transplant originally from Virginia, although I've also lived in Atlanta & Kansas City. Super into riding bikes, keyboards, premier league football, and playing games (always Destiny + something on the Switch).
