# Hey, I'm Elias #BlackLivesMatter
(he/him) I'm a product designer at Bonusly where I'm working on designing apps for healthier workplaces, specifically focusing on feedback and engagement tools. Previously I've worked in various design roles at agencies, small and large. Currently living in sunny Boulder, CO but I'm an east coast transplant originally from Virginia, although I've also lived in Atlanta & Kansas City. Super into trail running, premier league football, and playing FPS games although I have a special soft spot for open world games (playing The Last of Us Part II  rn).
