# Hey, I'm Elias
(he/him) I'm a senior product designer at Catalog, where I design and prototype apps for early stage startups. I also make [asciimoji.app](https://www.asciimoji.app/), tinker with some generative art and three.js on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/uhhlias.tez), and you can watch me stumble around in the dark on [Context](https://context.app/flexbox.eth). Previously I've worked at startups in senior IC roles as well as various design and art direction roles at agencies, small and large. Located in the teeny town of Pine, CO in the Rocky Mountains.
