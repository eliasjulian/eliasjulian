# Hey, I'm Elias
(he/him) I'm a senior product designer at [FireHydrant](https://firehydrant.com/), designing and prototyping the future of incident management for customers like Peloton, Stack Overflow, Twilio, 1Password, and many more. Previously I worked with early stage startups at a little design studio called Catalog, and spent years in individual contributor roles at both startups and agencies. I also make [asciimoji for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asciimoji-%E3%83%84/id1461670485), tinker with some generative art and WebGL on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/uhhlias.tez), and collect art on [Gallery](https://gallery.so/uhhlias). Located in the small mountain town of Pine, CO in the Rockies. Lets play Destiny or ~Fifa~ EA Sports FC and talk about mountain biking
