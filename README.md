# Hey, I'm Elias #BlackLivesMatter
(he/him) I'm a product designer at Bonusly where I'm working on designing apps for healthier workplaces, specifically focusing on feedback and engagement tools. Previously I've worked in various design and art direction roles at agencies, small and large. Currently living in sunny Boulder, CO but I'm an east coast transplant originally from Virginia, although I've also lived in Atlanta & Kansas City. Super into riding bikes, building keyboards, premier league football, and playing games (always Destiny + something on the Switch).
